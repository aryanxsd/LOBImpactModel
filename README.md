# ðŸ“˜ Limit Order Book Impact Modeling

This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of temporary market impact using Level-2 (MBP-10) limit order book data for three U.S. stocks: CRWV, FROG, and SOUN. We simulate order book dynamics, estimate the market impact of hypothetical orders, and model the cost curve using power-law functions.

## ðŸ§  Project Goals

- Reconstruct the limit order book from MBP-10 raw event data (top 10 levels).
- Simulate execution of various buy orders (100 to 5000 shares).
- Compute temporary price impact from these simulations.
- Fit a power-law model to estimate the relationship between order size and market impact.
- Answer two theoretical questions regarding impact modeling and execution strategy.
